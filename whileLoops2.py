"""Create a while loop that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 squared (1, 4, 9, 16, ... , 100), each on their own line.

Fill in the blank space so that our while loop goes from 1 to 10 inclusive.
Inside the loop, print the value of num squared. The syntax for squaring a number is num ** 2.
Increment num."""

    num += 1
  
  # Fill in the condition
  # Print num squared
  # Increment num (make sure to do this!)
