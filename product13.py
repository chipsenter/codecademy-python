"""Define a function called product that takes a list of integers as input and returns the product of all of the elements in the list. For example: product([4, 5, 5]) should return 100 (because 4 * 5 * 5 is 100).

Don't worry about the list being empty.
Your function should return an integer."""

  total = 1
  for num in list:
    total = total * num
