"""Create a function called flatten that takes a single list and concatenates all the sublists that are part of it into a single list.

On line 3, define a function called flatten with one argument called lists.
Make a new, empty list called results.
Iterate through lists. Call the looping variable numbers.
Iterate through numbers.
For each number, .append() it to results.
