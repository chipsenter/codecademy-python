We have seen that a positive stride progresses through the list from left to right.

A negative stride progresses through the list from right to left.

letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
print letters[::-1]
In the example above, we print out ['E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']."""



my_list = range(1, 11)

# Add your code below!
backwards = my_list[::-1]
