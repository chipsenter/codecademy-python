"""LOOPS
Counting as you go
A weakness of using this for-each style of iteration is that you don't know the index of the thing you're looking at. Generally this isn't an issue, but at times it is useful to know how far into the list you are. Thankfully the built-in enumerate function helps with this.

enumerate works by supplying a corresponding index to each element in the list that you pass it. Each time you go through the loop, index will be one greater, and item will be the next item in the sequence. It's very similar to using a normal for loop with a list, except this gives us an easy way to count how many items we've seen so far."""


choices = ['pizza', 'pasta', 'salad', 'nachos']

print 'Your choices are:'
for index, item in enumerate(choices):
  #print index, item
  print index + 1, item
