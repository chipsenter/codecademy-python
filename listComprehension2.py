This will create a new_list populated by the numbers one to five. If you want those numbers doubled, you could use:

doubles = [x * 2 for x in range(1, 6)]
# => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
And if you only wanted the doubled numbers that are evenly divisible by three:

doubles_by_3 = [x * 2 for x in range(1, 6) if (x * 2) % 3 == 0]
# => [6]

"""


doubles_by_3 = [x * 2 for x in range(1, 6) if (x * 2) % 3 == 0]

# Complete the following line. Use the line above for help.
even_squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11) if (x ** 2) % 2 == 0]

print even_squares
